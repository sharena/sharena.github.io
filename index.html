    <h1 class="title">ALL ABOUT, well ME</h1>


    <p> My name is Sharena and I really like coding because I like the challenge
    of figuring out a solution to a problem. Also I own two dogs which I am
    sure that most people found out due to the Human Bingo. Their names are
    Prince and Precious and Precious is 5 years and Prince is turning 6 years
    old tomorrow. They're both Beagles and I love my dogs, however, they can be
  trouble makers at times. </p>

<h2 class="title"> This is what I kind of look like </h2>
